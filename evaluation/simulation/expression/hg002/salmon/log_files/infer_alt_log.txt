[2022-10-04 04:21:30.607] [jointLog] [info] Computed 480,318 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2022-10-04 04:21:30.607] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4,985,549 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-10-04 04:21:30.619] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00034% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 3.

[2022-10-04 04:21:30.619] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments entirely discarded because of alignment score : 14,393
[2022-10-04 04:21:30.619] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments discarded because they are best-mapped to decoys : 10,494
[2022-10-04 04:21:30.619] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments discarded because they have only dovetail (discordant) mappings to valid targets : 8,565
[2022-10-04 04:21:30.696] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4985549 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
