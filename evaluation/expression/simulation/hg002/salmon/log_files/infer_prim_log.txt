[2022-09-26 07:40:27.738] [jointLog] [info] Computed 474,146 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2022-09-26 07:40:27.738] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4,985,380 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-09-26 07:40:27.750] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00034% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 3.

[2022-09-26 07:40:27.750] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments discarded because they are best-mapped to decoys : 10,623
[2022-09-26 07:40:27.750] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments discarded because they have only dovetail (discordant) mappings to valid targets : 8,402
[2022-09-26 07:40:27.859] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4985380 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
